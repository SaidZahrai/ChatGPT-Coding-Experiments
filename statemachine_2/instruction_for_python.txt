python script started with two arguments: 'filename', 'directory'
1. Make a dictionary to save the content of 'filename' in a structured way
2. Repeat for all lines of 'filename'
    a. Read a line and neglect empty ones or those with space or tabs
    b. Look for a valid posix filename after the prompt 'file:' and save it in 'fname'
    c. Read the text from the next line until the next 'file:' and save it in 'description'.
    d. Add the 'fname', 'description' to the dictionary
3. For all elements in the dictionary:
    a. take the 'directory' as the root.
    b. create the corresponding directories if they do not exist
    c. create` a file called fname
    d. save the corresponding 'description' in that file.
3.
