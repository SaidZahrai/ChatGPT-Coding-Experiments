#include "machine_one.h"
#include <iostream> // include necessary header files

// No additional implementation needed for the template class 'MachineOne', since all functionality is defined in the header file.

// This file is only necessary if there are specific implementation details that need to be separated from the header file.

// Alternatively, if all implementation is in the header file, this file can be left empty.

// However, if there is additional implementation in this file, it should follow the Google coding guidelines, with appropriate comments and formatting.
